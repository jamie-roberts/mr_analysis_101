IPython notebook covering the basics of magnetic resonance analysis

Getting Started
-----------------

A static version of this notebook is available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/moloney/mr_analysis_101/blob/master/mr_analysis_101.ipynb).

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/moloney/mr_analysis_101).

With the source code and a suitable Python environment you can run a "live" version of this notebook on your own computer. This will allow you to make modifications to the notebook and see the results immediately.

### Getting Python

You will need Python along with some of its numeric/scientific packages to run this notebook. If you are on Windows I recommend [pythonxy](http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/). [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is a cross-platform option (Windows, OSX, Linux). On Linux you might also just use your distributions package manager (e.g. `apt-get install python-numpy` on Debian/Ubuntu).

The specific packages needed for this notebook are:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* ipython
* nmrglue
* pydicom
* nibabel
